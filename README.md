## Introduction

Conditional statements like `if-else` are fundamental to any programming language. They allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. This repository includes several examples and practice problems to help you master the `if-else` statements in C++.

## Getting Started

To get started with the practice problems:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-if-else-practice.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory:**

   ```bash
   cd cpp-if-else-practice
   ```

3. **Compile and run the C++ code:**

   You can compile any `.cpp` file using a C++ compiler. For example:

   ```bash
   g++ example1.cpp -o example1
   ./example1
   ```

## Practice Problems

Here are some of the practice problems included in this repository:

1. **Even or Odd:** Determine if a number is even or odd.
2. **Positive or Negative:** Check if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
3. **Maximum of Three Numbers:** Find the largest of three numbers.
4. **Leap Year Checker:** Determine if a given year is a leap year.
5. **Simple Calculator:** Create a basic calculator using if-else.

Each problem comes with a sample solution and can be found in its respective `.cpp` file.
